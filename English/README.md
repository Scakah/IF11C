    Hi Silvie

    Just a quick note to say we are very sorry for the delivery delay. I'm afraid wel'll    have to put off the delivery for 10 dasy beacause of the truck drivers' strike. When   exactly do you need the goods? If it's very urgent i'll ask the manager of the     forwaredrs whether he can set up a special delivery somehow.

    I'll get in touch asap, but please let me know the latest date for the goods.

    Despite this, have a nice day!
    Rgds
    Jean
